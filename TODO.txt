Bugs:
Should hitting "escape" exit fullscreen mode by default?
Hitting enter on a choice control does nothing but play a sound

Finishing off 1.0:
High scores (including local persistence)
High scores (include global persistence)
Customizable controls?
Improve the instructions (add images, maybe show them automatically on the first game)
Option persistence
Music?
Go through TODOs in the code
Launch on http://avsn.sf.net/

Beyond 1.0:
Have a tutorial instead of a static instruction menu
Optimize transformations
Port to Windows 8?
Cache images automatically and have specific loading phases
Supply backup colors for images in one (data-driven) place
