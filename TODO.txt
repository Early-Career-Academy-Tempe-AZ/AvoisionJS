Bugs:
Should hitting "escape" exit fullscreen mode by default?
In IE, sound effects (after the first play) are truncated noticeably

Finishing off 1.0:
High scores (including local persistence)
High scores (include global persistence)

Improve the instructions (add images, maybe show them automatically on the first game)
Option persistence
Music?
Go through TODOs in the code
Launch on http://avsn.sf.net/

Beyond 1.0:
