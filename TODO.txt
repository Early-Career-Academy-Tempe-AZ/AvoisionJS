Bugs:
Persist full screen and audio settings?

Finishing off 1.0:
Notify the user when a new high score is set (or maybe show it during gameplay as well)
High scores (include global persistence)
Customizable controls?
Improve the instructions (add images, maybe show them automatically on the first game)
Option persistence
Music?
Go through TODOs in the code
Launch on http://avsn.sf.net/

Beyond 1.0:
Have a tutorial instead of a static instruction menu
Optimize transformations
Port to Windows 8?
Cache images automatically and have specific loading phases
Supply backup colors for images in one (data-driven) place
